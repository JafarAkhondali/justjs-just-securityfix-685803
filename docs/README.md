# Documentation

This directory contains the source code of [justjs.github.io](https://justjs.github.io).

[The non-versioned directory](./non-versioned) contains the main structure of the website, except for the generated documentation.

[The versioned directory](./versioned) contains the structure for generated documentation of the next version. I.e: files under [/versioned](./versioned) will be added to `https://justjs.github.io/vx.x.x`, where `vx.x.x` is the next/released version.

When a new version is released, the documentation is generated in the
`public` directory, and pushed to [this repository](https://github.com/justjs/justjs.github.io).
